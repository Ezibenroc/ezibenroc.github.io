#+title: My homepage with org-mode
#+author: Tom Cornebize

* Introduction

This setup is based on Emacs with [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]]. The CSS is adapted from [[http://polaris.imag.fr/arnaud.legrand/][Arnaud
Legrand's website]], while the Emacs functionnalities to publish the website have
been implemented by Duncan Mac-Vicar P. (see his [[https://duncan.codes/posts/2019-09-03-migrating-from-jekyll-to-org/][his introductory post]] and the
[[https://github.com/dmacvicar/site.org][original source]]).
* Usage

- Posts go into =posts/=
  Preferably in their own subdirectory together with all their assets (self-contained)
- Tutorials go in =tutorials/=, as they are rendered (for now) with the [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][readtheorg]] theme

To generate:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output site will be rendered in =public/=.
* License
The code used for generating the site is licensed under the [[file:LICENSE][MIT]] license.
