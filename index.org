#+HTML: <img src='img/picture.jpg' class='onright photo' alt=''/></div>

Since October 2017, I am a PhD student at the [[https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/][Université Grenoble Alpes]], under the supervision of [[http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/arnaud.legrand/][Arnaud Legrand]]. I am
working on the simulation of HPC workloads.  Prior to that, I did my master thesis on the same topic (thesis available
on [[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01544827v1][HAL]]).

My CV is available in [[file:cornebize.pdf][PDF]] and [[file:cornebize.html][HTML]] (last update: 11 oct. 2017).
