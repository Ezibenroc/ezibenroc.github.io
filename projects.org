Several open-source projects to which I contribute.

* [[http://roaringbitmap.org/][Roaring bitmaps]]

* [[http://projetpp.github.io][Platypus]]
Platypus is a modular and open source question answering framework. Its main purpose is to answer to questions asked in
a natural language (e.g. in English). For instance, it answers correctly to the question:

#+begin_quote
What is the birth date of the president of the United States?
#+end_quote

For more information, read the [[file:doc/platypus_report.pdf][report]] or the [[file:doc/platypus_slides.pdf][slides]]. This work was initially a student project. It was done as part of
the master's first year at the ENS Lyon, in a team of seven. The project has then been sold to [[https://lexistems.com/][Lexistems]] and is no
longer actively maintained by ourselves.
